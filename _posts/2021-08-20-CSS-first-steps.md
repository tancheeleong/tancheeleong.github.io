MDN [CSS First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) introduces me to the styling possibilities with CSS. The key to implementing CSS correctly to the HTML document lies in the correct selection of HTML elements. The selectiom is based om one or more combination of type, class, position and state. If more than one CSS rules apply to a particular element, the conflict is resolved by the cascade and specificity rules. Dynamic stylings can be effected with functions (such as calc()) and @rules (such as @media). Last but not least, it is recommended to declare the CSS rules in external stylesheets, in line with best practices to keep content separated from styling.
