MDN [CSS Building Blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks) goes into more details on every aspects of CSS. It took me quite a while to read through with greater appreciation of the power and versatility of CSS styling. Every elements in a HTML is contained in a box, with all aspects of the box available to CSS styling. The color, filling (backround color or image) and sizing of the box. Then of course, the content is also styled through CSS. Lovely stuff.
