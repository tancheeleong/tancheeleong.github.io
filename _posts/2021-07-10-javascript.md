title: Touching on basics of Javascript
tags: javascript learning

Building on the basic webpage created a few days ago, I followed MDN tutorial to add Javascript just before the </body> tag. I was able to change text and image, prompt user for input, and store values in localStorage. I learnt that there was no alert to user when browser attempted to retrieve an invalid item from localStorage, due to my typo.

The basic syntax that I learnt:

```javascript
if (condition) {
    statement;
} else {
    statement;
}

let variable = value;

function() {
    statement;
}
```
