[MDN debugging HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML) gives a good introduction to debugging tools available. Our browsers (desktop versions) already include developer tools such as DOM inspector and Javascript console. I will be checking out the [tools for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). Another good resource is the [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/).
