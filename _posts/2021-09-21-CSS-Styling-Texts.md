MDN [CSS Styling Texts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text) describes how text can be styled in general, and in the context of lists and links. Font-wise, we can choose web safe fonts that are most likely already available on user's device or machine. We could also use online font services such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Lastly, we could acquire font files from font distributors or foundry and store them on our website to be downloaded together with the webpages.
