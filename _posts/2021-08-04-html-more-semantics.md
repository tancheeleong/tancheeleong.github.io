[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks) stresses the importance of meaningful linked text and hint for links leading to downloads, emails or actions rather than another webpage.

[Advanced Text Formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting) introduces the more common advanced formatting. Quotes (block and inline) elements include cite attributes, commonly the links of the sources which is not shown nor linked directly from webpage. We could use cite elemenr to present the title of source page, wrapped in hyperlink to it. Code element facilitates the presentation of programming codes. And most interestingly, there is time element with datetime attribute offering a stamdard format that can be parsed to extract such time information.

[Website Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) shows how to give semantics meaning to the structure with the use of header, navigation, sidebar, main and footer.
