title: Using HTML to Express Semantics
tags: HTML

From the [MDN Web Docs to HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals), I had the impression that we should use HTML elements to express semantics of the contents. This would improve the search results of the page for SEO, which takes headings as part of search. It will also improve the accessibility to audience who relies on screen readers, where the emphasis <em> and strong <strong> elements are more relevant than italics and bold styling. 

For purpose of presentation, we should use CSS to style our web page.
